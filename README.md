Create a CSV file with the following columns:
- `Group`: Topic name for organizing assignments
- `Title`: Assignment title
- `DueDate`: Due date in M/D/YYYY format
- `ScheduledDate`: Publish date in M/D/YYYY format
- `Points`: Maximum points (numeric)

Unit 1,Quiz 1,1/29/2025,1/19/2025,50
```

## Assignment Renamer

```python
# Configuration
ENCODED_COURSE_ID = "YOUR_ENCODED_COURSE_ID"  # Your base64 encoded course ID
PREFIX = "[BD] "  # Prefix to add to assignments
CSV_FILE = "titles.csv"  # CSV file with assignment titles to match
```

### CSV Format for Renaming

Create a CSV file with a `Title` column containing the exact titles of assignments to be renamed:
```csv
Title
Assignment 1
Quiz 1
```

## Quiz Response Grader

### Configuration

Edit the constants at the top of `grade_quiz_responses.py`:
```python
# Configuration Constants
FORM_ID = 'YOUR_FORM_ID'  # Your Google Form ID
SPREADSHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID'  # Your response spreadsheet ID
```

### Required Google API Access
- Forms API (for reading responses)

### Setup Instructions
1. Create a Google Form for your quiz
2. Set up a response spreadsheet
3. Get the Form ID from the form URL
4. Get the Spreadsheet ID from the spreadsheet URL

python grade_quiz_responses.py
```

The script will:
1. Check for new form responses
2. Process the latest response
3. Calculate the total score
4. Record the timestamp and score in the spreadsheet

## Usage

1. Update the configuration constants in the desired script
2. Run the appropriate script:
   ```bash
   # For creating assignments
   python script.py
   
   # For renaming assignments
   python rename_assignments.py
   
   # For creating quizzes
   python create_quiz.py
   
   # For grading quiz responses
   python grade_quiz_responses.py
   ```

## Finding Your Course ID

1. Open your Google Classroom course
2. The course ID is in the URL:
   ```
   https://classroom.google.com/c/YOUR_COURSE_ID
   ```

## Notes

- Assignments with "N/A" or "â€”" for dates or points will be skipped
- Future-dated assignments are created as drafts
- All assignments are due at 23:59 on their due date
- All assignments are scheduled to publish at 00:01 on their scheduled date
- The renaming script will skip assignments that already have the specified prefix
- Quizzes are created as drafts and need to be reviewed before publishing
- Google Forms must be created separately before linking them to quizzes
